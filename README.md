## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend build tooling

### What I learned

First time I use vite and tailwind to build a page. Tailwind layer components are used in this project to make the code simpler.

### Continued development

Initial commit still have rooms to improve, such as pledge toggle on modal, and usage of reference to scroll to the position.
